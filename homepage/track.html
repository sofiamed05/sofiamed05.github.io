  <h1>Track!</h1>
<h2>Why Joining A Team Is Important!</h2>
<p>For many years, sports have been associated with me in one way or another. The first time I joined an actual team was in middle school: Track and Field. Our team was considered fairly large, and I took part in the 100 meter relay with 3 other teammates. Relays require consistent teamwork, as baton pass-offs are necessary in getting headstarts and keeping up with the flow of the race. Over all, doing stretches and practices as a group was important as it embedded the idea of "team." In freshmen year, I was eager to join Nest's Winter Track Team and it was a very alike experience to my previous team. When Covid-19 hit, I didn't run as much as school resumed online for almost two years. Subsequently, I lost my love for running, but even so, the foundation track once laid out is stuck with me. Today, as a senior, I rejoined the Track Team. Although my burned out passion for running is still present, running in itself is beneficial-it's a good work out, my teammates are good friends of mine, and the adrenaline rush that comes with accomplishing races brings me flashbacks to the days filled and driven by passion and competitiveness.</p>
