    <h1>Volleyball!</h1>
  <h2>How Finding A New Hobby Influenced Me!</h2>
  <p> During the pandemic, I took up a different sport: volleyball. After watching an anime titled 'Haikyuu' that tells the story of a teen who consistently trained to become one of the greatest volleyball players in Japan, volleyball piqued my interest and I joined a league. I assumed that volleyball wasn't a difficult sport but my assumption was quickly reinforced by my coach who put us through drills that required several hours of practice to be perfected. Not being as experienced as some of the other girls, I was fueled by determination to become well-rounded in the sport. Not only did I practice those weekends during the league, but afterschool at the park where I played against the handball walls. I would be so infatuated to get in a good practice that I would end up staying much longer then necessary to perfect my recieves, serves, sets, etc. Through this great deal of practice I molded myself into the well-rounded play I aspired to be. Even though I still have to grow more as a player, the determination I gained through putting in immense practice and effort to be successful is seen through other work like in AP Biology. By reading my textbook and having a curiousity to learn more about its roots, I've become better oriented with its widespread information. </p>
